Ionic Hacker News
=====================

This is a sample app built by the core team of Ionic. It's a means of "eating our own dogfood" by building a practical
app in Ionic. It was built using the [Ionic Tabs Starter](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-tabs).

This app makes no guarantees for stability. In fact, as it's a place we often test pre-release builds of Ionic, it's
often broken as we iron out new features for Ionic.

The app is a Hacker News reader. It allows you to browse, search, share, read, and view the comments of Hacker News
posts. It communicates with a closed source Hacker News scraper that provides a RESTful JSON API.
